"front_gate","The front_gate is just north of the Dark Castle's drawbridge. It is 10 feet tall and reenforced with steel bands. Imposing indeed! There is rusty_lettering across the top of the gate and a rusty keyhole next to a handle. The front_gate is closed."
"iron_portcullis","Beyond the iron_portcullis you can dimly make out the next room. The iron_portcullis is closed."
"control_panel","The control_panel contains three levers: a left_lever, a middle_lever, and a right_lever. The control_panel also contains a big_red_button. There are no directions posted as to what the controls are for or how to use them (a clear ISO lapse is ever you've seen one Burt)."
"left_lever","The left_lever is down."
"middle_lever","The middle_lever is down."
"right_lever","The right_lever is down."
"big_red_button","The big_red_button is to the right of the three levers. You have no idea what it does but you have an almost irrestiable urge to push it."
"throne","High-backed and intricately carved, the throne is secured to the floor and wedged against the castle wall behind it. It does not look entirely comfortable but it must have once been very grand indeed. Alas, like the rest of Dark Castle, it is now dingy and ominous with only faint hints of its past glory. It must have heard many secrets in its time... perhaps it still holds some?"
"stone_coffer","This is the sort of coffer that, in better days, was no doubt filled to the brim will brightly shining gold pieces. Unfortunately, as you'd begun to fear, those days are long past and now the coffer is filled only with a deep layer of dust."
"crystal_box","Atop an ornate pillar to the left of the throne sits an intricate crystal_box. Through the glass you can make out and aged but intact scroll that fits perfectly within the container. There is a silver keyhole on the front of the crystal_box that glitters brilliantly - much like the shiny_sword in fact - in the otherwise dark and brooding room. The top of the crystal_box is engraved with calligraphy. The crystal_box is closed."
"rusty_key","An old Rusty Key... the one they gave you at the pub when you swore to pillage the Dark Castle. What could you possibly do with it?"
"stale_biscuits","The stale_biscuits are rather unappetizing. There is a trademark baked into the biscuits."
"shiny_sword","The sword glitters even in the dim light. Despite its age, the edge is keen and looks ready for action. There are dwarven_runes engraved upon the blade."
"grimy_axe","A nasty looking weapon - and poorly maintained too. If you ever get out of this castle you should set aside some time to polish it. You notice uppon inspection that there is some small_print on the handle."
"torn_note","This must have dropped from the goblin's hand when you slew it. The note is ragged and torn. On it there is some messy_handwriting."
"silver_key","The small silver_key glitters in the dim light. It certainly stands out in the otherwise dreary Dark Castle. If you find a glittering silver keyhole somewhere this is definitely the key for it!"
"scroll_of_the_king","Wow this thing is fancy! Huge letters with little pictures inside them and all sorts of curvy flourish at the end of each and every letter. Burt, your humble biscuit-baking, pub-crawling brain doesn't even know what to call this thing but if it did you would call it an illuminated manuscript composed (of course) of illuminated_letters. Thanks to the hard and thankless work of your first grade teacher, Ms. Lusk, you could probably just manage to read the illuminated_letters."
"royal_crown","Giant rubies: check. Dozens of glittering jewels: check. Gleaming gold and precious metals: check. Yep, this is a *seriously royal* crown you've got here Burt!"
"hedgehog_broach","The silver hedgehog_broach is about an inch in diameter and is carved with the crest of a hedgehog bearing a sword and a key. It's strangely familiar... you've seen one just like it... long ago... examining the hedgehog_broach up close triggers a long forgotten memory... \nyou were only five or six years old... you and all your family were at the bedside of your great grandmother, Nana Baker. She was old - very, very old -  so old no even was sure how old - not even Nana. She'd been unable to eat or get out of bed for the past week and the village healer had given his solemn verdict that at long last her time had come. The whole village had come round to pay their last respects but now it was just family left. She looked very tired and her eyes were closed. \n'Thomas', said Nana, meaning your father, 'I'm weary... be a good lad and go heat me some tea.. Nice and hot please.'. Next she sent your mother off for a special pillow she'd loaned to a friend. Soon every member of the family was off on an errand and it was just you and Nana. \nQuite suddenly, Nana's eyes opened, bright blue and wide awake. 'Well, Burty, finally we can have a little chat. I wish you were a bit older but now will have to do. Tell me Burty, how do ya feel about baking biscuits?' \n'It's na so bad' you'd stammered back. \nNana laughed and gave you a warm smile. Don't feel bad Burty, I wasn't much of a Baker myself - had a bit of a wild romantic streak in me - just like you. You remind me so much of my Willy.. and that's not entirely an accident mind you. Thought I might see a resemblance in your grandfather or father but they were mindful lads and happy enough to be Bakers. I guess it's waited for you to show itself. Probably just as well. \nAh Willy... now don't get me wrong, Papa Baker was a good man - hard working and with a kind heart - took me hand when many others wouldn't have and always treated me good. But you're from different stock Burty, very different. And that comes with some responsibilities.. you've got a destiny 'afore you and that can be hard on young man with no expecting of it. That's why I'm telling you this now. \nYour real great grandpa was Willy... William Herbert... last of the line of Flatheads.. or so everyone's been told. He was a handsome man.. like you Burty.. and unlike the rest of his family - full of romance and laughter and travel and adventure. Could be a bit reckless at times but he had a good heart. He proposed to me right proper he did... didn't really have to... he was so high up in society... and so much older too... but the moment I told him he dropped right to one knee and popped the question. Didn't care the least what people said. Swore we'd elope if the high priest wouldn't marry us... and he would have too!\nAlas, that crazy man... four months before the big day he was wandering about the castle entrance, wearing his bathrobe and royal_crown, smoking his pipe and reading a book as he walked.. as usual.. and boom, he trips on the drawbridge and falls right into the moat... eaten right up in one bite by one of those mean old crocodiles that have swum in it forever. Oh the day I heard the news...' And with these words she touched the hedgehog_broach she always wore over her heart. It was a dark day Burty, a dark day for me an' for the castle and all the lands around. \nSomeday Burty William Baker, someday you'll be King. And when you is, you be a good King... a kind and courageous and bold king.. and when you is King don't ya be going walking off the edge of the drawbridge with no weapon in your hands and breaking young girl's hearts.. you hear me? \nStunned by this strange tale... you began to stammer an answer but just then your Father returned with the hot tea. With a wink just for you, Nana's eyes closed again and she sank back into the bed. Minutes later she was gone. \nFor years and years you wondered what she was talking about.. and eventually you began to doubt the conversation had ever even happened... over time it had faded completely... but here in Dark Castle, with the hedgehog_broach before you, the memory is clear and real.. Nana was buried with her beloved broach.. she had insisted on it... this must have been a matching mate.. presumably worn by Willy himself."

"intro","Greetings brave adventurer!\nYou are Burt-the-Boneheaded, the only adventurer brave - or foolish - enough to enter the Dark Castle in search of treasure."
"fist","Yep, that's your fist. Still bruised from the last time you swung and missed and hit a wall..."
"burt","That's you. A fine specimen of a man. If not for the drooling and the farting I don't know how you'd fend off the ladies"
"conscience","Burt, Dark Castle is quite murky enough without pondering your prodigal and Hal-esque misspent youth!"
"nothing","Burt, nothing is nothing. Nada. Zilch. Empty. Like that noggin of yours.."
"tapestries","The main_hall tapestries are vast and elaborate, covering both the east and the west walls. They appear to depict an unkempt figure breaking into a solitary white house and from there pillaging a Great Underground Empire. Strangely, there is a looming figure near the top of the west tapestry who appears to be tapping with his fingers on a many-buttoned plank and staring intently into a window filled with text. For some reason the figure disconcerts you.. his presence in the tapestry fills you with existential dread and forces you to question your agency and the very nature of your being... BURT!! Get hold of yourself man! You're a mangey, pub-crawling adventurer who lives in his mom's basement. You don't even know what half those words mean. Stop staring at tapestries and get out there and find the treasure you fool!!"
"alcove","A small indentation in the west wall near the iron_portcullis. It is just deep enough to hold one control_panel and one goblin."
"family_tree","It appears to show the family tree of the Flathead dynasty. Though generally agreed to have peaked (nadired?) during the reign of Dimwit Flathead and petered out shortly there-after during the inglorious rulership of Wurb Flathead, this family_tree tells a different story. It claims that a remote uncle of Wurb continued the line for seven more generations and eventually ended with William 'The Wanderer' Flathead only a little over 100 years ago. The area below William is indistinct and feels incomplete.. as if there are details still waiting to be filled in.\nAt the very top of the family_tree you see a royal crest. Oddly enough, it appears to be a hedgehog bearing a shiny sword and a silver key."
"hedgehog","This poor little hedgehog has seen better days. It looks gaunt and like it skipped breakfast - and maybe lunch and dinner too. But despite looking in need of a good meal the hedgehog's eyes have a bright, territorial gleam in them and it appears to have quite a preference for shiny things. You don't know why but you feel an innate fondness for this small but valiant creature."
"dead_hedgehog","Tragically, some mean and nasty adventurer has slain this innocent woodland creature. In death it looks piteous and in need of a hug."
"goblin","The goblin stands in the alcove guarding the control_panel and is armed and dangerous. It wields a grimy_axe and looks at you with watchful malice. This goblin clearly takes its guard duties very seriously. It would not be wise to approach the iron_portcullis or the control_panel (or the goblin) un-armed."
"dead_goblin","Even in death the goblin looks fierce and resolute. Whoever dispatched this enemy must be an adventurer of some renown!"
"entrance","*** Entrance ***\nYou are standing atop a drawbridge at the entrance to the dark_castle. To the north is the front_gate. To the south the way back home. To the east and west and below you are the moat."
"main_hall","*** Main Hall ***\nYou are standing in what was once the sumptuous main hall of the castle. Faded tapestries hang on the east and west walls. The front_gate is to the south. And a foreboding archway leads to the north."
"antechamber","*** Antechamber ***\nYou are standing in a what feels more like a wide, tall-ceilinged corridor than a room. Apparently this is the room-before-the-room, the pre-room before the really, really grand room that comes after it. If so, the next room must be quite something because back in it's day this spot was clearly impressive. Alas, like all of the castle it has fallen on dark times and now feels more sinister than grand. The east and west walls are bare stone. To the south is an open passageway leading to the main_hall and to the north there is an iron_portcullis that guards the path to the grand chamber beyond. Near the iron_portcullis on the west wall there is a small alcove. It appears to have a control_panel with some levers and a big red button on it but you can't see it very well due to the dim light. The whole north end of the room is cloaked in shadows that make you uneasy."
"throne_room","*** Throne Room ***\nThe room you're currently in is vast - almost cavernous. At the far end sits what must have once been a grand and glorious throne. To the right of the throne is a giant stone_coffer and to the left an elegant pedestal that holds what appears to be a delicate crystal_box. On either wall there are tall windows - now shattered and ruined but you've heard stories of the glowing stained glass that once filled them. And above the room's entrance hangs a vast (though quite dusty) family_tree."
"take-shiny_sword","The moment you approach the sword the territorial hedgehog springs forward, blocks your path, and bares it's teeth."
"east-blank-crown","With courage and boldness to spare you leap from the drawbridge into the murky waters of the moat. A less resolute adventurer might have turned tail at the sight of the oncoming giant crocodile but not you Burt. Treading water with your feet you take a two-handed grip on your weapon and get ready to face your destiny. Just before reaching you the primitive reptile realizes that you are armed and ready to fight (crocs are famously near-sighted). In surprise and fear it belches up the contents of it's stomach - including the royal_crown - and flees in fear. With a deft athleticism unlike anything you've ever displayed before today you snag the crown with your off hand, toss it into your backpack, and in one smooth motion adroitly hoist yourself back onto the drawbridge one handed. The lads at the pub would fall over at the sight of your skill and courage! (though mind you, they fall over on a regular basis as it is)"
"east-blank-no_crown","With courage and boldness to spare you leap from the drawbridge into the murky waters of the moat. Apparently the last time you did this you terrified the local wildlife so much that they are still in hiding. After treading water for a few minutes you clamber back onto the drawbridge."
"drop-shiny_sword","The hedgehog beams at you with gratitude for returning the shiny_sword. From a hidden fold of its fur it takes out a silver_key and places it at your feet with a bow."
"push-throne","You push hard on the throne. Nothing happens but one side of the throne feels a bit askew - as if something was wedged behind it. Strange..."
"pull-throne","Hoping to find some sort of secret compartment filled with gold - or at least a good souvenir to show to the lads back at the pub - you pull and prod the throne. As you are pulling the throne forward you hear a metallic 'clank' and something rolls out from beneath the throne.. it appears to be a hedgehog_broach. It must have been wedged between the throne and the castle wall all these years... since the days of the last King!"
"read-illuminated_letters-wrong_room","Upon reading the scroll aloud you hear a distant rumble as if great powers are at work... but then it fades... perhaps you need to read it somewhere else to complete the recipe?"
"read-illuminated_letters-no_hedgehog","Upon reading the scroll aloud there is a rumble and a bright flash of light in the sky.. but then it dims and the sound fades... Alas, some vital ingredient has gone missing in the castle... this is grim Burt... you may need to start your adventures over from the start and play through with a more benevolent spirit."
"read-illuminated_letters-no_crown","Upon reading the scroll aloud the clouds outside part, the sun shines, there is a booming sound... but then it fades away abruptly... there's one missing ingredient that's keeping the scroll_of_the_king from performing its magic... if only there was some token of royal lineage... perhaps some form of headpiece you could wear.. that would proclaim your birthright..."
"read-illuminated_letters-win","Upon reading the scroll aloud the clouds outside part, the sun shines, there is a booming sound like a great and thunderous gong that echoes and rebounds across the land! By the scroll's power the castle is scourgafied and all that was once dark is now glimmering with color and ligtht. Where Dark Castle once lurked, now gleams Bright Castle! The coffer magically fills with gold (and also a conveniently provided and legally complete deed to Bright Castle). And suddenly Burt, you find your own somewhat threadbare Baker's clothing replaced by garments of rich velvet and silk. Well done Burt! To the amazement of your family and friends - and the eternal pride of your great grandmother - you are now the Barron of Bright Castle!!"
"goblin_attacks-parry","The goblin does not take kindly to your presence in the north side of the room. It attacks with a lightening-fast swing of the grimy_axe and you only barely manage to parry with your own weapon."
"goblin_attacks-death","The goblin does not take kindly to your presence in the north side of the room. It attacks with lightening-fast swing of the grimy_axe and you are helpless against the onslaught. You will need a better weapon than your fists if you are to survive this foe."
"push-big_red_button-open","You hear a loud clank, a whirring of gears, and the iron_portcullis suddenly opens."
"push-big_red_button-close","You hear a loud clank, a whirring of gears, and the iron_portcullis suddenly closes."
"push-big_red_button-fail","You press the button and hear a whirring of gears but nothing happens."
"wear-royal_crown","You now feel more regal."
"wear-hedgehog_broach","You can't bring yourself to put it on - you have too many memories of seeing your dear Nana wearing it. Perahps there is something else around the castle you could wear? Something royal?"
"take-royal_crown-worn","You suddenly feel a bit less kingly."
"entrance-north","You approach the daunting front gate."
"entrance-south","Don't be ridiculous Burt. You just swore to the whole pub that you'd march into the Dark Castle and grab the gold and buy everyone drinks with it. \nThat is why they gave you the rusty_key. You can't turn back now!"
"entrance-east","With confidence and vigor you pitch off the side of the drawbridge and into the moat. Who knew it would be full of crocodiles?"
"entrance-west","With confidence and vigor you pitch off the side of the drawbridge and into the moat. Who knew it would be full of crocodiles?"
"main_hall-north","You pass through the foreboding archway."
"main_hall-south","You exit through the front_gate."
"antechamber-north","You approach the iron_portcullis."
"antechamber-south","You exit through the southern passage."
"throne_room-south","You approach the iron_portcullis."

Your voice booms forth of its own accord - as if some part of your brain has been getting ready to say these words all your life. The rest of brain is struggling just to make sense of what you're saying with such confidence... it seems to be something along the lines of a recipe with ingredients... so if the 'heir to the true king' (whoever that might be)... reads 'this precious parchment'(you're pretty sure that means the scroll you're holding)... in the throne_room (you've been there!)... while 'adorned with the gleaming headpiece of state' (whatever that means)... and also requiring that 'so long as the castle remains invested with a representative of our most noble heraldic charge seen ever upon our crest, seal, and glorious coat of arms' (even Ms. Lusk would have no clue what this means but she would notice that an awful lot of the illuminated_letters in this sentence include a hedgehog with a sword and a key)... and then it finishes on a rather dramatic high note with the words 'upon the hour these conditions be met, a new King of Bright Castle shall shine forth and be proclaimed!'"
"hedgehog-attack-fist","You take a wild swipe at the hedgehog with your fist but it nimbly leaps aside. BURT! What has gotten into you?? We have an evil castle to conquer. Stop trying to slay defenseless woodland creatures!"

"goblin-attack-fist","With an echoing war cry you charge the goblin, flailing your fists wildly in all directions as you come. This technique has served you well during drunken altercations at the pub but it proves less effective against a trained goblin guard. The last thing you ever see is the goblin's grimy_axe swinging towards your head."
"goblin-attack-shiny_sword","The shiny_sword surges with power and lethal heft in your hand. A preternatural calm comes over you. You were born for this moment. Your raucous pub crawling days were a mere temporary distraction.. you know in your bones that this primal showdown was meant to be and that, with the shiny_sword at your command, you were meant to win it. Resolute, and with a confidence you have never even imagined having up until this very moment, you stride to meet your foe in battle and dispatch him with one blazing fast strike of your sword."

It's hard to imagine but your great grandma Nana used to tell wonderous stories of the old days when the castle gleamed brightly on its hill and brought order and goodness to the land. Maybe it's because of the stories but you've always had a bit of an itch to venture inside. The place has somehow called to you - almost daring you to enter -  and now that a round of beer and your alehouse repuation as a fearless ruffian are on the line you intend to answer the call!"
