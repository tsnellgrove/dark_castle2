"Dark Castle" is a very simple Zork-like text adventure game. I have written it in order to teach myself Python. The program is written using Pythonista and Working Copy on an iPad.

The program's language skills are very basic. All commands are either one word (a simple command verb like "north") or two words (simple verb-noun combinations like "attack goblin"). Adjectives are directly attached to the noun they are associated with via an underscore (e.g. "take rusty_key"). There are no articles or pronouns.

There are only four rooms and the puzzle difficulty progresses from trivial to moderate through the course of the game. The content is appropriate for kids.

I'm very much a beginner at both Python and text adventure writing so I welcome your feedback and suggestions! Also, feel free to clone and extend my code with new or different rooms, features, and verbs. Let me know if you do - I would love to play whatever game you create! I do ask that you credit my initial work and that you clearly state in the intro if the game is no longer appropriate for kids.

Lastly, after a bit more clean up of this version I plan to create an object-oriented version that supports better linguistics so advice on object oriented techniques is much appreciated as well.
