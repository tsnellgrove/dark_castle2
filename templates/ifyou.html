  <h1>If You Teach Your Pa Some Python<br>
  (A Cautionary Tale)</h1>
  
      <p>If you teach your Pa some python<br>
	  He will get excited<br>
	  And want to start "a project"<br>
	  He will wander around the house<br>
	  Saying "hmmm"<br>
	  (thinking of an idea)<br>
	  And before you know it<br>
	  He will be writing a "text adventure"<br>
	  (Which is a strange old game with only words)<br>
	  Then he will get very enthusiastic<br>
	  And declare that he needs an IDE<br>
	  (Because someone on YouTube has one)<br>
	  Then there will be typing<br>
	  And more typing<br>
	  And more typing</p>

      <p>Next it will get a bit tricky<br>
	  And he will wander around the house<br>
	  Saying "hmmm"<br>
	  (thinking about dictionaries of dictionaries)<br>
	  Eventually he will want you to try his game<br>
	  And will be very proud to have created<br>
	  One door and one key<br>
	  But there won't actually be a room<br>
	  Behind the door<br>
	  Which won't be very interesting<br>
	  So then there will be typing<br>
	  And more typing<br>
      And more typing</p>

      <p>Then one day<br>
	  There will be some unfortunate language in the house<br>
	  And he will declare that he needs "version control"<br>
	  (Which means "Git")<br>
	  And he will wander around the house<br>
	  Saying "hmmm"<br>
	  (thinking about Git clients and respositores)<br>
	  Then he will proudly tell you<br>
	  That his code is on "GitHub"<br>
	  And he will go back to typing<br>
	  And more typing<br>
      And more typing</p>

    <p>Eventually<br>
	After more "hmmm"s<br>
	And much more typing<br>
	the game will be "mostly done"<br>
	He will be very proud of it<br>
	And want the whole family to play it<br>
	To give him "feedback"<br>
	(but only Mommy<br>
	will actually play the whole thing..<br>
	and she'll help him with his spelling too)</p>

	<p>So then<br>
	He'll want to show it to all his friends<br>
	He will declare that he is "just going to put it on the web"<br>
	Which will mean<br>
	Learning Flask and Jinja2<br>
	And I'm sorry to say<br>
	There will thne be more unfortunate language in the house<br>
	Because client-side programming is "strange and unnatural"<br>
	But eventually<br>
	After quite a bit of typing<br>
	(And delting)<br>
	And some wandering around the house<br>
	Saying "hmmm"<br>
	And more typing<br>
	(And more deleting)<br>
	And a last bit of typing</p>

There will be "much rejoicing"
And the game will be running
On the local web server
He will declare "now I just need to spruce it up a bit"
Which will mean "CSS"
And more YouTube classes
And also "Exercising aesthetic judgment"
Then there will be
More wandering about the house
Saying "hmmm"
Then it will be time again for typing
And more typing
And a bit of photo editing

Finally
He will be ready to put the game on the "real" web
Which wil mean a "Pythonanywhere"
Which will seem great at first
Until it becomes clear that this means
Using
Bash shell and vi
Then there will be more unforutunate language in the house
And also long stories
About the last time he used vi
30 years ago
But after a bit more typing
and a few more "hmmm"s

At last
The game will be up on the "real" web
He will send everyone he knows a link to it
Then just when the "project"
Is finally finished
he will declare that he needs to do it all over again "right"
Which will mean "object oriented code with a NoSQL DB"
(This is why this a cautionary tale)</p>
