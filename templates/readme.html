    <h1>Dark Castle Read Me</h1>
    <br>
    <p>"Dark Castle" is a very simple Zork-like text adventure game. I have written it in order to teach myself Python. The program is written using Pythonista and Working Copy on an iPad.</p>
	<p>The program's language skills are very basic. All commands are either one word (a simple command verb like "north") or two words (simple verb-noun combinations like "attack goblin"). Adjectives are directly attached to the noun they are associated with via an underscore (e.g. "take rusty_key"). There are no articles or pronouns.</p>
	<p>There are only four rooms and the puzzle difficulty progresses from trivial to moderate through the course of the game. The content is appropriate for kids.</p>

	<p>I'm very much a beginner at both Python and text adventure writing so I welcome your feedback and suggestions! Also, feel free to clone and extend my code with new or different rooms, features, and verbs. Let me know if you do - I would love to play whatever game you create! I do ask that you credit my initial work and that you clearly state in the intro if the game is no longer appropriate for kids.</p>
	<p>My next goal is to "flaskify" the app and put it on the web so that I can get feedback on it from others. I'm new to flask so this may take a bit. After the "flaskification" I plan to create an object-oriented version that supports better linguistics so any advice on object oriented techniques is much appreciated!</p>
